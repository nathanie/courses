after installing cygwin on windows I still experienced several issues with installing awscli.
the main reason wass the recognition of the anaconda python install within sygwin 
the workaround is to install python seperatly within cygwin

these were resolved through the following code:
wget rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
apt-cyg install python
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
python get-pip.py 
pip ninstall awscli
